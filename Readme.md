Piper Model testing of a security droid.


https://github.com/rhasspy/piper

Tested and build using Python 3.10/3.11 and Pip 23 not 24> and great due the dep failing.

Tested using linux and using Windows with Docker image build

Use Visual Studio Code and build the docker file in this repo
name the image k2so-piper
In windows just run the k2so.bat file
You might have to change the location of where the volume mount goes to point to where your models are.
When I did this originally I was working a clone version of piper and added a models folder and dump everything in there. 


There is a piper windows standalone file and a system tray version (untested)
